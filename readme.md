"Google Replicate" is a project that aims to replicate the basic functionality and design of Google's homepage using modern web development technologies. The project uses React as the primary front-end framework, with React Router for client-side routing and TailwindCSS for styling.

The project includes a search bar that allows users to input search queries and displays search results based on Google's search results.

For backend functionality, the project uses the Hugging Face (API from project I created) to fetch search results / search suggetions from Google's search engine.
